  <h2 class="ui dividing header">Defining Definitions</h2>

  <p>Definitions in semantic are groups of css, fonts, images, and javascript which make up a single element on a page. A UI definition is portable, and stand-alone</p>

  <p>Definitions avoid conflicts with other elements by descending rules from a common namespace.</p>

  <p>Semantic has five different ui definitions. These are useful patterns for describing re-usable parts of a website.</p>
  <ul class="ui list">
    <li><b>Element</b> - a basic building block of a website, exists alone or in homogenous groups</li>
    <li><b>Collection</b> - a heterogeneous group of several elements which are usually found together</li>
    <li><b>View</b> - a way to present common website content</li>
    <li><b>Module</b> - an element that also includes behavior as part of its definition</li>
    <li><b>Behavior</b> - a set of behaviors not specfically tied to a design</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="ui dividing header">UI Elements</h2>

  <p>UI Elements are interface elements which do not contain other elements inside themselves. This can be thought of as similar in definition as an "element" in chemistry.</p>

  <p>UI elements can have plural definitions when they are known to exist together frequently.</p>

  <p>In this case each button will be large because we understand it is a part of the large button group</p>
  
  <div class="code" data-type="html" data-label="true">
    <div class="large ui buttons">
      <div class="ui button">Cancel</div>
      <div class="ui button">Continue</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  Examples of UI elements:
  <ul class="ui list">
    <li>Buttons</li>
    <li>Labels</li>
    <li>Headers</li>
    <li>Progress bars</li>
  </ul>


  <h2 class="ui dividing header">UI Collections</h2>
  
  <p>UI Collections are groups of heteregeneous UI elements which are usually found together. Carrying the chemistry metaphor, these can be thought of as molecules.</p>

  <p>UI collections have a definition of elements that exist, or could exist inside of them. They do not usually require all elements to be found, but they describe a list of the "usual suspects". Unlike elements, collections are not typically useful to define in plural.</p>

  <p>Examples of UI collections:</p>
  <ul class="ui list">
    <li>Forms</li>
    <li>Tables</li>
    <li>Grids (Layout)</li>
    <li>Menus</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="ui dividing header">UI Modules</h2>

  <p>UI modules are elements where it's behavior is a fundamental part of its definition. UI Modules are dependent on the javascript which carry their definition. They also may be more complex, and have a variety of different functions. Further abusing the scientific analogy: These can be thought of as "organs".</p>

  <p>Examples of UI modules:</p>
  <ul class="ui list">
    <li>Popups</li>
    <li>Modals</li>
    <li>Chatrooms</li>
    <li>Calendar Pickers</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="ui dividing header">UI Views</h2>
  
  <p>UI Views are common ways to structure types of content so that it can be understood more easily. A view's definition in semantic only describes the content which typically occupies the view.</p>

  <p>Examples of UI views:</p>
  <ul class="ui list">
    <li>Comment Feed</li>
    <li>Activity Feed</li>
    <li>Product List</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="ui header">Authoring UI</h2>

  <p><b>All UI</b>: The specification defines class name and html structures which can be used to represent an element
</p>
  <p><b>Elements</b>: An element definition gives states which an elements can occupy, common types of that element, and if necessary, defines how the element functions in groups.</p>
  <p><b>Collections</b>: Collection definitions list elements that it can include, and variations which can apply to both the collection, or individual elements found in the collection.</p>
  <p><b>Modules</b>: Module definitions include a list of behaviors that are commonly associated with an element</p>
  <p><b>Views</b>: View specifications defines the types of content the view usually display, and the heirarchy typical to presenting this content to the user.</p>

  <h3 class="ui header">Mostly tag ambivalent</h3>

  <p>Semantic is based on class names, instead of tags. This means, except for links, tables and form elements, you can use semantic with tags like &lt;div&gt; &lt;article&gt; &lt;nav&gt; without any difference.</p>

  <h3 class="ui header">Context sensitive</h3>

  <p>In Semantic, variations maintain context based on the element they modify, but keep the same vocabulary between elements. Just like how in English, the adjective 'big' may describe a different scale for a big planet versus a big insect.</p>

  <p>For example, a form you can have a variation called "inverted". This changes the appearance of form elements to work on dark backgrounds.</p>
  
  <div class="code" data-type="html" data-label="true">
  <div class="ui inverted form">
      <div class="field">
          <label>Name</label>
          <input type="text">
      </div>
  </div>
  </div>

  <p>The same variation can also be useful in the context of a menu.</p>
  
  <div class="code" data-type="html" data-label="true">
  <div class="ui inverted menu">
      <div class="item">Section 1</div>
      <div class="ui simple dropdown item">
          Dropdown
          <div class="menu">
              <div class="item">Dropdown item 1</div>
              <div class="item">Dropdown item 2</div>
          </div>
      </div>
  </div>
  </div>

<!-- 
  <h3 class="ui header" class="ui header">Known Limitations</h3>

  <p>Semantic uses the UI namespace to separate element definitions from the content that they define. This means that namespaces might conflict with other definitions if a variation or a type used matches the namespace of another ui definition.</p>
