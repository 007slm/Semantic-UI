  <h2 class="ui dividing header">Introduction</h2>

  <h3 class="ui header">Core Contributions</h3>

  <p>There are a variety of ways to contribute to the development of Semantic. We are a very new project and are looking for an enthusiastic and like-minded group of core contributors. We use the lovely free project management software <a href="https://trello.com/jack148/recommend">Trello</a> for keeping track of project issues and updates.</p>

  <p>We're also currently working on "Dev kits" for creating and testing each type of UI definition, which should be available shortly, so hold tight.</p>

  <p>Some boards are open publicly, others are limited to contributors. Anyone can share ideas for the direction of the project using our public boards.</p>

  <h3 class="ui header">Style Guide</h3>
  <p>Contributors should read over the coding guidelines for the project. Most importantly, the guide for language.</p>

  <h2 class="ui dividing header">Bugs & Issues</h2>

  <p>Please submit any bugs you encounter when using the library to our <a href="https://github.com/jlukic/Semantic-UI/issues?state=open">Github Issues Tracker</a>.</p>

  <p>Pleaseinclude a set of steps to reproduce the issue and any related information, browser, OS. If we can't see the issue then it will make solving things much more difficult.</p>

  <h2 class="ui dividing header">Pull Requests</h2>

  <p>Anyone can jump on the issues board and grab off bugs to fix. Make sure however

  <h2 class="ui dividing header">Expanding Core UI</h2>

  <p>Semantic is looking for people to help contribute new UI components, and suggest extensions for our core library</p>

  <p>If you have any suggestions for components missing from Semantic which you'd like to see in future versions please add suggestions to our public UI board. The current list of upcoming components, and there current development status can be seen on the contributor UI board.</p>

  <a class="ui button" href="https://trello.com/b/dtmaAEmg/semantic-ui-components-contributors">Contributor Board</a>

  <h2 class="ui diving header">Community Development</h2>

  <p>We're looking currently for ideas on the best way to expand Semantic to include both core library and third party components. This requires creating a component specification which can be used by anyone to create components, and a package management system (website or command line) for distributing them.</p>
