  <p> Writing front end code shouldn't require learning the naming or programming conventions of a particular developer. Semantic is a methodology for coding front end designed to make adopting and sharing code with others easier.</p>

  <h2 class="ui dividing header">What's Different</h2>

    <div class="ui header">Tag ambivalent.</div>
    <p>UI definitions are, for the most part, tag ambivalent. That means you can use div, article, section, span, whatever tag you please. Special tags like a, table, td still carry special meaning however.</p>

    <div class="ui header">UI definitions are portable and self-contained.</div>
    <p>Although ui elements may reference other elements, ui definitions, in general, are stand-alone. That means choosing to use semantic doesn't mean adopting an entire framework, or rewriting your codebase. Pick and choose what you want.</p>

    <div class="ui header">UI definitions are themeable</div>
    <p>Describing your site's content using a common language allows other developers to create UI definitions to match a shared vocabulary. Instead of retooling your website's html, simply download a different element theme.</p>

    <div class="ui header">Only the important stuff</div>
    <p>Instead of giving every possible variation, or behavior under the sun, element definitions are designed to be a starting off point. No oversized downloads, just the stuff to get you started on your new project. We know your itching to code your own features anyway.</p>
