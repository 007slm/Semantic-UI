  <p> Writing front end code shouldn't require learning the naming or programming conventions of a particular developer. Semantic is an attempt to design a front end library built around common usage and convention to make adopting and sharing code with others easier.</p>
  <p>The semantic framework is an attempt to create a less prescriptive front end library which others can extend and modify to enhance their projects.</p>
  <h2 class="ui header">Getting Started</h2>
  
  <p>UI definitions in Semantic are namespaced with the class name <b>ui</b>. This is to help differentiate between parts of a UI element, and the element itself. In the example below you can see that item must be a part of a menu definition.</p>
  
  <div class="code" data-type="html" data-label="true">
    <div class="ui menu">
      <div class="item">Home</div>
      <div class="item">Inbox</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="ui menu">
    <div class="item">Home</div>
    <div class="item">Inbox</div>
  </div>
  <div class="ui divider"></div>
  <p>All UI definitions in semantic are stand-alone, and do not require other components to function. However, components can choose to have optional couplings with other components.</p>
  
  <p>For example you might want to include a badge inside a menu. A label inside of a menu will automatically function as a badge.</p>
  
  <div class="code" data-type="html" data-label="true">
    <div class="ui menu">
      <div class="item">Home</div>
      <div class="item">
        Inbox 
        <div class="ui label">22</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="ui menu">
    <div class="item">Home</div>
    <div class="item">
      Inbox 
      <div class="ui label">22</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="ui divider"></div>
  <p>Class names in semantic always use single english words. If a class name is an adjective it is a <b>type</b> or <b>variation</b> of an element. A <b>type</b> is a mutually exclusive change to an element, while a <b>variation</b> can be used together with other variations.</p>
  <p>Semantic has five different ways UI elements can be defined. As an element, collection, view, module, or behavior.</p>
  
  <ul class="ui list">
    <li><b>Element</b> - a basic building block of a website, exists alone or in homogenous groups</li>
    <li><b>Colleciton</b> - a group of several elements which are usually found together</li>
    <li><b>Module</b> - an element where its behavior is included as part of its definition</li>
    <li><b>Behavior</b> - a definition of behavior that exists without any physical description</li>
    <li><b>View</b> - a way to present specific website content</li>
  </ul>
