    <h2 class="ui dividing header">What's Different?</h2>

    <h3 class="ui header">Descriptive not Prescriptive</h3>
    <p> Writing front end code shouldn't require learning the naming or programming conventions of a particular developer. Instead of using short-hand, or codified naming conventions, semantic uses simple, common language for parts of interface elements and familiar rules used in natural languages for describing elements.</p>

    <h3 class="ui header">Tag ambivalent.</h3>
    <p>While standards groups and browser developers may decide the arbitrary interpretation of html tags in the browser, front end developers have always had complete autonomy over the interpretation of class names of elements.</p>
    <p>Keeping that in mind, interface definitions in Semantic are tag ambivalent. That means you can use div, article, section, span without affecting the display of the element. Special tags like a, table, td still carry special meaning in certain circumstances however.</p>

    <h3 class="ui header">Powerful tools for expressing groups and collections.</h3>
    <p>It's much easier to say in english, there are three tall men, then there is a tall man, a tall man and a tall man. Yet HTML often deals with groups this way.</p>
    <p>In Semantic element definitions can be expressed in groups have shared attributes like size, color, type avoiding repetitive declarations</p>

    <h3 class="ui header">Portable and self-contained.</h3>
    <p>UI components in Semantic can be downloaded individually, defining only optional couplings with other components. That means choosing to use semantic doesn't mean adopting an entire framework, or rewriting your codebase. Pick and choose what you want.</p>

    <h3 class="ui header">Shared language, different implementations</h3>
    <p>Semantic defines a relationship between UI element qualities and class names. Describing your site's content using a common language allows other developers to create UI definitions to match one shared vocabulary. This means you can redesign your website without retooling your html. Simply alter the look and feel of your UI using a different definition.</p>

    <h3 class="ui header">Only the important stuff</h3>
    <p>Instead of giving every possible variation, or behavior under the sun, element definitions are designed to be a starting off point. No oversized downloads, or kitchen sink, just the stuff to get you started.</p>
